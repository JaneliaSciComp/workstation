<b>Are you sure you want to delete the &quot;stitched image&quot; of [%s] for sample %s and remove it from reprocessing?</b>
<br/>
This will cause removal of:
<ul>
    <li>
The stitched image file (both lossless and visually lossless)
    </li>
    <li>
Neuron Separation files
    </li>
    <li>
Alignment Board files
    </li>
</ul>
MIPs and Movies will be kept, but with limited access and will not be regenerated with
 new algorithms when the sample is reprocessed.
<br>
Original LSMs will always be kept.
