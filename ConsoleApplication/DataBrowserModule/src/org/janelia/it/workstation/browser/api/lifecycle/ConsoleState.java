 * Static class for keeping track of the console's startup state. Certain things (logging, reporting

 * 
 * This class is as basic as possible, to avoid all kinds of possible race conditions and other startup 
 * dependency issues. In particular, it does not import any other classes, like the EventBus, or any 
 * logging frameworks.
