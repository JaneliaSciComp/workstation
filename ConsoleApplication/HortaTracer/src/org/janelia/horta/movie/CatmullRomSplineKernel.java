/**
 * Spline function for smooth interpolation of viewer states.
 * Catmull-Rom spline has the special property that it passes exactly
 * through all control points, while maintaining continuous first
 * derivatives, resulting in a smooth and graceful fly-through that
 * exactly visits each of the input key frames.
 * 
 * Notice that we include a spherical spline interpolation of Quaternions,
 * which can be used to get even the camera rotation to look very smooth, eliminating
 * that pop-and-lock 1970s robot-dance look that lesser animation tools
 * often exhibit.
