/**
 * This class acts as a generic queue mechanism for passing execution between threads.
 * This class creates a queue that accepts Runnables.  It then executes the Runnables
 * in one of several threads from a thread group that it manages.  The number of
 * threads executing can be set by the client, as well as the priorities of the
 * threads. This class speeds execution in a multi-threaded app as it eliminates
 * the longer overhead associated with creating and killing threads many times.  It
 * also eliminates the potencial for many, many threads to be created without that intent.
 * <p/>
 * This class also will run runnables directly if numThreads is 0
 * <p/>
 * Defaults: Priority=normal
 * Execution on ThreadQueue threads (not System Event Queue)
