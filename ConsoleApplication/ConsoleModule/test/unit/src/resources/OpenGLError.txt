This is repeated here, from https://www.opengl.org/wiki/OpenGL_Error so that any text search of the hexadecimal values in an IDE will turn up these
descriptions.

GL_INVALID_ENUM, 0x0500
    Given when an enumeration parameter is not a legal enumeration for that function. This is given only for local problems; if the spec allows the enumeration in certain circumstances, where other parameters or state dictate those circumstances, then GL_INVALID_OPERATION is the result instead.
GL_INVALID_VALUE, 0x0501
    Given when a value parameter is not a legal value for that function. This is only given for local problems; if the spec allows the value in certain circumstances, where other parameters or state dictate those circumstances, then GL_INVALID_OPERATION is the result instead.
GL_INVALID_OPERATION, 0x0502
    Given when the set of state for a command is not legal for the parameters given to that command. It is also given for commands where combinations of parameters define what the legal parameters are.
GL_STACK_OVERFLOW, 0x0503
    Given when a stack pushing operation cannot be done because it would overflow the limit of that stack's size.
GL_STACK_UNDERFLOW, 0x0504
    Given when a stack popping operation cannot be done because the stack is already at its lowest point.
GL_OUT_OF_MEMORY, 0x0505
    Given when performing an operation that can allocate memory, and the memory cannot be allocated. The results of OpenGL functions that return this error are undefined; it is allowable for partial operations to happen.
GL_INVALID_FRAMEBUFFER_OPERATION, 0x0506
    Given when doing anything that would attempt to read from or write/render to a framebuffer that is not complete.
GL_CONTEXT_LOST, 0x0507 (with OpenGL 4.5 or ARB_KHR_robustness
    Given if the OpenGL context has been lost, due to a graphics card reset.
GL_TABLE_TOO_LARGE1, 0x8031
