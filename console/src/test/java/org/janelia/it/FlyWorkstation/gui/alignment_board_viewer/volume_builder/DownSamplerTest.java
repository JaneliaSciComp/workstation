/**
 * Created with IntelliJ IDEA.
 * User: fosterl
 * Date: 3/25/13
 * Time: 11:26 PM
 *
 * Test for the renderables-builder base class facility methods.
 *
 * Maintenance Note: if the down sampler is ever intentionally changed, such that the output below is supposed
 * to change from what it is at time of writing, simply verify that the "Report Not as Expected:" contents
 * are correct for the new design.  Then, for each test, log-scrape that output and insert it into the appropriate
 * constant definition.  Afterwards, when the test is re-run, the reports should again match.
